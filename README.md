## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my journey in machine learning. It includes various projects I've worked on, detailed notes on different machine learning concepts, and datasets used in my experiments.

## Projects

### 1. Movie Recommender System
- **Description:** The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning project aimed at recommending movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system provides personalized movie suggestions that align with the user's taste. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment phases to build an efficient recommendation engine.
- **All information Provided in folder**


*... other projects are under development.*
